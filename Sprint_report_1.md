# Sprint 1 Report (8/21/2023 - 10/5/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
### AI Team

### Non-AI Team
* Production has been started on Homework assignment 1

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### AI Team

### Non-AI Team
We have begun working on the first homework assignment. This assignment has us creating a parser for the C- language using Flex and Bison. We have run into struggles as we do not have access to any of the previous lecture videos. As Flex and Bison are not as frequently used as many other CS topics, searching for answers to our questions has also become difficult.

## Unfinished Work
### AI Team

### Non-AI Team
While we have begun the work on the parser, their are a few rules and characters that we have not been able to fix in the parser. We have the lines that give errors marked and set for addressing, though we are facing some troubles in figuring out how to address them.
