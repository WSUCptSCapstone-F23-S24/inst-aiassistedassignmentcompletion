# Sprint 1 Report (8/21/2023 - 10/5/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
### AI Team

### Non-AI Team
* Production has been started on Homework assignment 1, which involves creating a parser for the C- language using Flex and Bison. We learned a lot about comiplers and C- given we have never worked with either.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### AI Team

### Non-AI Team
We have begun working on the first homework assignment. This assignment has us creating a parser for the C- language using Flex and Bison. We have run into struggles as we do not have access to any of the previous lecture videos. As Flex and Bison are not as frequently used as many other CS topics, searching for answers to our questions has also become difficult.

One of the primary obstacles we have encountered is the unavailability of previous lecture videos that could have provided valuable insights and guidance for this specific task. As Flex and Bison are not as commonly used as some other topics in computer science, finding relevant resources and solutions to our questions has proven to be difficult. Nevertheless, we remain committed to overcoming these challenges and completing the assignment successfully.


## Unfinished Work
### AI Team

### Non-AI Team
While we have made progress on the parser, there are still some unresolved issues related to specific rules and characters within the C- language. We have identified the lines of code that are causing errors and have marked them for further investigation and resolution. However, we are currently facing difficulties in determining the appropriate strategies to address these issues effectively.

We will continue to collaborate and explore various solutions to resolve these problems and ensure the parser functions correctly.

### Non-AI Team
1. **Create Makefile** (Milestone: Sprint 1) [Link](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/3)
   - Assigned to: Adam Karaki
   - Story Points: 3
   - Description: Developed a Makefile to streamline the project's build process. This Makefile defines compilation rules and dependencies, making it easier for the team to build the project consistently.

2. **Build Bison Parser** (Milestone: Sprint 1) [Link](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/2)
   - Assigned to: Adam Karaki
   - Story Points: 5
   - Description: Successfully built the Bison parser for the C- language as part of Homework Assignment 1. The parser is now capable of recognizing and processing C- language constructs, a crucial step in completing the assignment.

3. **Implement Flex Scanner** (Milestone: Sprint 1) [Link](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/1)
   - Assigned to: Evan Smith
   - Story Points: 4
   - Description: Completed the implementation of the Flex scanner for the C- language. The scanner is now capable of tokenizing input source code, providing essential input to the Bison parser. This work represents a significant milestone in the assignment's progress. 

Each of these tasks has been successfully completed, contributing to the overall advancement of Homework Assignment 1 and our project's objectives.

Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:

* [URL of issue 1] (https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/5) <<Parser presents some errors on a few lines, but we have not found enough details on how to address the errors, just their location. >>
* [URL of issue 2 ] (https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/4)<<Parser works for some errors, but we have run into problems with getting errors for some characters.>>
