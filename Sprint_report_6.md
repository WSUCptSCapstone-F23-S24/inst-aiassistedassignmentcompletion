# Sprint 6 Report (3/2/2024 - 4/2/2024)
## Sprint Video [Link]() TODO

## What's New (User Facing)
### AI Team
 * The AI team has completed the development of the database (milestone 3) in Python for our database application, marking a significant milestone in our project.

### Non-AI Team
 * The Non-AI team completed milestone 2 
we also have finished development of the parser and database for our third milestone. The parser reads all of the data in each of the files, connects to our database, and inserts all of the relevant data for our project into it. 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### AI Team
The AI team has achieved a milestone by successfully concluding the SQL for our database application using Python. This development enables us to query businesses based on a specified state, city, or ZIP code, providing valuable insights into successful businesses in these regions. Furthermore, the database categorizes these businesses, offering a comprehensive overview of their respective industries. This accomplishment enhances the capabilities of our application, contributing to a more insightful analysis of business data.

### Non-AI Team
The Non-AI team made significant significant progress during this sprint. Since we were unable to finish the second milestone before the previous sprint, the team was able to finish a full implementation of a Qt Framework UI with various data. 
completed a parse and inserting file which traverses each of the files to extract all relevant data. 


## Unfinished Work
### AI Team
We were unaware that we had a zipcode stats json file, so we still have to complete that for our third milestone.

### Non-AI Team
Currently, we are continuing development with parsing all data files into the UI. We are able to parse the input data into the console. Our current development is focusing on parsing the states and zipcodes into the UI.
