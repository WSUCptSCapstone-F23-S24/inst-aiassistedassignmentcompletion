## What's New (User Facing)
### AI Team
 * The AI team successfully completed the frontend UI development for our database application using the Qt framework, showcasing our proficiency in Qt development and contributing to the overall progress of the project

### Non-AI Team
 * The Non-AI team has continued to develop the UI. The development of the frontend UI will be completed shortly. We have completed the UI, but are re-organizing the code structure.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### AI Team
The AI team has achieved a milestone by successfully concluding the frontend UI development for our database application using the Qt framework. The robust frontend design ensures a streamlined user experience, reflecting our commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions.

### Non-AI Team
The Non-AI team has worked diligently on the creation and development of the frontend UI. We are nearly finished, but are currently organizing the code structure to prepare for seamless integration of the remaining modules when moving forward. 

## Unfinished Work
### AI Team
As part of our ongoing development, we are currently engaged in crafting the database structure for our application, emphasizing data integrity and reliability. Simultaneously, we are diligently working on a Python middleware to handle the submission of queries to the database. These critical components are integral to the application's functionality and performance.

### Non-AI Team
As we wrap up our UI development we are transitioning towards working with Python to parse and prepare to insert JSON files into the database. The parser is the key component in our end development within the database. With the amount of data being processed before database linking, we plan on creating an efficient parser which will limit the need for a lengthy insertion process.
