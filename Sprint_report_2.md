### What's New (User Facing)
#### AI Team
Since sprint 1, the AI-Team has completed all parts relating to Homework 1, "The Scanner". All the assignment requirements have been met with the assistance of ChatGPT. We have also altered and refined the AI reporting statistics document for cleanliness. 

#### Non-AI Team
In this sprint, we finalized Homework 1 which we had started in Sprint 1. Furthermore, the non-AI team focused on completing Homework Assignment 2 for the rest of sprint, which builds upon the foundation laid during the previous sprint. Assignment 2 involves further development of the C- language parser and the implementation of additional features.

### Work Summary (Developer Facing)
#### AI Team
The AI team was able to complete all issues relating to Homework 1. We ran into significant errors during development as ChatGPT has struggled to understand C- grammar. However, through constant guidance it was able to provide a working solution for the homework.

Moving onto the second homework assignment has been very difficult. ChatGPT has been unable to make progress any portion of it. We have tried different approaches multiple times to no avail. We even attempted to use different plugins available to provide it all the necessary tools, including the C- grammar documentation. Each implementation was riddled with errors and unusable. It always ended up in a loop with constant errors.

#### Non-AI Team
The non-AI team has made significant progress and was able to complete Homework Assignment 1 and 2 during this sprint. This assignment involves expanding and enhancing the C- language parser that was initially developed in the previous sprint. 

The primary focus has been on improving the parser's error handling and enhancing its ability to recognize and process various C- language constructs. Despite the challenges we encountered, such as limited access to resources and troubleshooting difficulties, we have managed to make substantial advancements in the development process.

### Unfinished Work
#### AI Team
We have been unable to use ChatGPT for any solution of HW2. It continues to struggle regardless of any input.

We are in the process of understanding and developing Homework 2 with minimal AI assistance.


#### Non-AI Team
While we have made significant progress on Homework Assignment 2, there are some unresolved issues related to error handling and advanced feature implementation. These issues are marked for further investigation and resolution.

Our plan for the next sprint is to focus on resolving these remaining issues and completing Assignment 2 successfully.

### Code Files for Review
#### AI Team
All files in the AI branch are pending review. The updated statistical report is pending review as well.


#### Non-AI Team

All the code files in the Non-AI branch are currently pending review. We will review these files in the coming week.

## Retrospective Summary
### AI Team
What Went Well:
- **Completion of all assignment requirements of HW1**: We initially struggled to work with the AI due to the nature of the assignments C- grammar. However, we were able to guide the AI to completing a fully working assignment.
- **Adaption of the AI Statistical Report**: Transitioning the documentation from a simple Google Doc. file to a Google Sheets file. Overall it is easier to track all of the related data.

What Didn't Go Well:
- **Homework 2 Implementation**: ChatGPT was unable to provide any solution to any part of Homework 2. We are now forced to work similarly to the Non-AI team in developing HW2. We have to circle back and learn all course materials to implement HW2 without the AI implementing the solution. We plan on using it for minor development assistance relating to error checking, but we do not believe it will be helpful for HW2.




### Non-AI Team
What Went Well:
- **Progress on C- Parser:** Despite the challenges we faced, we made significant progress on developing the C- language parser in this sprint. We successfully implemented advanced features and improved error handling.
- **Getting the Flex Scanner Working As We Want:** While we originally found ourselves on the wrong track for how we can use the Flex scanner, we found a proper understanding and are now able to use the scanner to help us with our project.
- **Completing Two Homework Assignments:** We were able to finish the first homework assignment from Sprint 1 along with beginning and finishing the second homework assignment.
