### What's New (User Facing)
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team
In this sprint, we finalized Homework 1 which we had started in Sprint 1. Furthermore, the non-AI team focused on completing Homework Assignment 2 for the rest of sprint, which builds upon the foundation laid during the previous sprint. Assignment 2 involves further development of the C- language parser and the implementation of additional features.

### Work Summary (Developer Facing)
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team
The non-AI team has made significant progress and was able to complete Homework Assignment 1 and 2 during this sprint. This assignment involves expanding and enhancing the C- language parser that was initially developed in the previous sprint. 

The primary focus has been on improving the parser's error handling and enhancing its ability to recognize and process various C- language constructs. Despite the challenges we encountered, such as limited access to resources and troubleshooting difficulties, we have managed to make substantial advancements in the development process.

### Unfinished Work
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team
While we have made significant progress on Homework Assignment 2, there are some unresolved issues related to error handling and advanced feature implementation. These issues are marked for further investigation and resolution.

Our plan for the next sprint is to focus on resolving these remaining issues and completing Assignment 2 successfully.

### Completed Issues/User Stories
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team
During this sprint, we successfully completed the following tasks related to Homework Assignment 2:

1. Read and get an understanding of HW2 (Milestone: Sprint 2) [Link]((https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/13))
   - Assigned to: Adam, Evan
   - Description: We read about the HW2 requirements along with conferming the required materials we would need and concepts we would need to spend to researching.
2. Create Tree Structure (Milestone: Sprint 2) [Link](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/14)
   - Assigned to: Adam, Evan
   - Description: Created the structure of the tree based on the TreeNode class we were given in the assignment details.
3. Implement Core Functions and Logic For the Complier to Work With the Tree (Milestone: Sprint 2) [Link](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/16)
   - Assigned to: Adam, Evan
   - Description: Got the desired core functions and logic for the compiler to work with the tree-based structure.
4. Debug Code and Test (Milestone: Sprint 2) [Link](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/17)
   - Assigned to: Adam, Evan
   - Description: Ironed out the bugs in the code and ran test cases.
5. Final Tests and Quality Assurance (Milestone: Sprint 2) [Link](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/inst-aiassistedassignmentcompletion/issues/18)
   - Assigned to: Adam, Evan
   - Description: Ran the final tests and made cleanliness changes.


### Incomplete Issues/User Stories
#### AI Team




#### Non-AI Team
All the issues for the Non-AI team's Sprint 2 were completed and closed. In preparation for Sprint 3, we opened an issue that will have us prepare and research for the HW3 assignment.

### Code Files for Review
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team

All the code files in the Non-AI branch are currently pending review. We will review these files in the coming week.

## Retrospective Summary
### AI Team




### Non-AI Team
What Went Well:
- **Progress on C- Parser:** Despite the challenges we faced, we made significant progress on developing the C- language parser in this sprint. We successfully implemented advanced features and improved error handling.
- **Getting the Flex Scanner Working As We Want:** While we originally found ourselves on the wrong track for how we can use the Flex scanner, we found a proper understanding and are now able to use the scanner to help us with our project.
- **Completing Two Homework Assignments:** We were able to finish the first homework assignment from Sprint 1 along with beginning and finishing the second homework assignment.
