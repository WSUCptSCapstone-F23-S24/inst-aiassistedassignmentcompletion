### What's New (User Facing)
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team
In this sprint, we finalized Homework 1 which we had started in Sprint 1. Furthermore, the non-AI team focused on completing Homework Assignment 2 for the rest of sprint, which builds upon the foundation laid during the previous sprint. Assignment 2 involves further development of the C- language parser and the implementation of additional features.

### Work Summary (Developer Facing)
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team
The non-AI team has made significant progress and was able to complete Homework Assignment 1 and 2 during this sprint. This assignment involves expanding and enhancing the C- language parser that was initially developed in the previous sprint. 

The primary focus has been on improving the parser's error handling and enhancing its ability to recognize and process various C- language constructs. Despite the challenges we encountered, such as limited access to resources and troubleshooting difficulties, we have managed to make substantial advancements in the development process.

### Unfinished Work
#### AI Team



#### Non-AI Team
While we have made significant progress on Homework Assignment 2, there are some unresolved issues related to error handling and advanced feature implementation. These issues are marked for further investigation and resolution.

Our plan for the next sprint is to focus on resolving these remaining issues and completing Assignment 2 successfully.
