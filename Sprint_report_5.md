## Sprint Video [Link](https://youtu.be/iRcMLkzRI_c)

## What's New (User Facing)
### AI Team
 * The AI team successfully completed the frontend UI development for our database application using the Qt framework, showcasing our proficiency in Qt development and contributing to the overall progress of the project

### Non-AI Team
 * The Non-AI team has finished development of the User-Interface (UI), using the Qt framework, for our Yelp application. It allows any user to interact with the application, regardless of development knowledge.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### AI Team
The AI team has achieved a milestone by successfully concluding the frontend UI development for our database application using the Qt framework. The robust frontend design ensures a streamlined user experience, reflecting our commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions.

### Non-AI Team
The Non-AI team finished the development of the UI using the Qt framework. Each part of the UI is complete, awaiting the insertion of the parsed data for the states and zipcodes. We have created a simple user-friendly interface for anyone to use. Each portion of the UI is contained in a Qt groupbox for cleanliness. Each element is labeled with a unique name to prevent potential developer errors during development. The UI is one of the most important aspects of the Yelp application moving forward.  

## Unfinished Work
### AI Team
As part of our ongoing development, we are currently engaged in crafting the database structure for our application, emphasizing data integrity and reliability. Simultaneously, we are diligently working on a Python middleware to handle the submission of queries to the database. These critical components are integral to the application's functionality and performance.

### Non-AI Team
Currently, we are continuing development with parsing all data files into the UI. We are able to parse the input data into the console. Our current development is focusing on parsing the states and zipcodes into the UI.
