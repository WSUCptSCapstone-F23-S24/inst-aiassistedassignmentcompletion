## Abstract and Motivation:

Recent advances in AI, particularly the emergence of large language models like ChatGPT and Bard, have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize various aspects of the software development process. This project, "AI-Assisted Programming for Compilers," is designed to investigate the extent to which these AI models can facilitate the development of solutions for academic programming assignments in the context of our Compilers class (CS 445) at the University of Idaho.

### Project Overview:

The primary objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of AI assistance in aiding students during the completion of programming assignments in the field of compilers. Specifically, we will assess how AI can assist in tasks such as code generation, script creation, and documentation writing. Our team will be divided into two subgroups, each with a distinct approach:

1. **Subgroup A (No AI Assistance):** This subgroup will complete assignments without utilizing any AI assistance, relying solely on traditional programming techniques and human problem-solving skills.

2. **Subgroup B (AI Assistance):** This subgroup will actively seek AI assistance, leveraging AI models like ChatGPT and Bard to aid in various stages of assignment completion.

### Research Methodology:

To evaluate the effectiveness of AI assistance, we will conduct a series of experiments across multiple assignments. For each assignment, both subgroups will work on the same task, and we will document the following:

- The time taken to successfully complete the assignment.
- Any challenges or limitations encountered during the assignment.

### Expected Outcomes:

Through this project, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

1. Gain insights into how AI can expedite the process of solving complex programming assignments, particularly in the field of compilers.

2. Compare and contrast the performance of Subgroup A (no AI assistance) and Subgroup B (AI assistance) in terms of assignment completion time, quality of solutions, and overall effectiveness.

3. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing AI systems, particularly ChatGPT and Bard, in assisting with programming tasks.

4. Provide valuable information and recommendations for the integration of AI tools into the curriculum of our Compilers class.

By the conclusion of this project, we hope to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the role of AI in education and its potential to enhance the learning experience for students pursuing computer science and related fields. Our findings will be documented, analyzed, and shared with the academic community to encourage further research in this exciting area.
