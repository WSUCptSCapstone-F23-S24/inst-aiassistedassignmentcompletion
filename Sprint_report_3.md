## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### AI Team
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

### Non-AI Team
The Non-AI team finished homework 3, which was begun in Sprint 2, along with starting and finishing homeworks 4 through 6. We were able to continuously build up on the knowledge we gained from each of the previous homework assignments to complete homeworks 4 through 6 at a faster pace than the previous sprints. 

## Unfinished Work
### AI Team
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.

### Non-AI Team
The Non-AI team still needs to finish working on the 7th homework assignment. We plan to have this finished over the upcoming break.
