## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
### AI Team
The AI team finished homeworks 2-5 this Sprint. In Sprint 2, we had significant issues using ChatGPT. We were able to complete some work with the assistance of ChatGPT since then. While GPT has struggled with the coursework, it has been able to clarify answers, and provide some information that we are able to use. However, the improvement seems  minimal in the knowledge it has for our course. Every time GPT updates we have to change our approach. Limitations and alterations that have been implemented can significantly impact the approach needed to receive a positive answer. It takes nearly up to a week in some instances to understand how to re-approach it, but we have significantly improved our ability to adapt with the changes. We have learned as the homeworks have increased in complexity, there are too many files for GPT to comprehend. Even with the 10 file limit, usually GPT only looks at one or two files. Now we are more focused on snippets of code or questions strictly through chat as we have found that it increases the probability of a working response. 

### Non-AI Team
The Non-AI team finished homework 3, which was begun in Sprint 2, along with starting and finishing homeworks 4 through 6. We were able to continuously build up on the knowledge we gained from each of the previous homework assignments to complete homeworks 4 through 6 at a faster pace than the previous sprints. 

## Unfinished Work
### AI Team
The AI team currently is working on the 6th homework assignment. Our current plan is to have the 6th and 7th homework assignments completed over the break. ChatGPT has significantly degraded in the ability of assisting with the complexity of the assignments. 

### Non-AI Team
N/A, we completed the work given the extension from the professor
